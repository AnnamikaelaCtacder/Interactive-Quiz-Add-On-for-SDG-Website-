            <img src="images/health.jpg" alt="Health Image" class="health-image">
            <h3>The challenges to health and well-being are multifaceted, stemming from a range of interconnected factors:</h3>
            <ul class="health-bullet-points">
                <li>Socioeconomic Inequalities: Barriers to accessing healthcare, education, and nutritious food disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.</li>
                <li>Environmental Factors: Pollution and climate change contribute to the rising burden of diseases.</li>
                <li>Mental Health: Stigma and lack of resources exacerbate mental health crises, often overlooked in public health discussions.</li>
                <li>Inadequate Infrastructure: Insufficient investment in public health systems hinders effective responses to health emergencies.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Addressing these root causes is vital to creating a healthier, more equitable world for all.</h4>
